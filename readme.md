I will add cmake later, for now you have to compile the code yourself.
If you don't know how to, just paste the code of the version you want inside gdb online debugger, the files are all standalone.

main.c - interactive playing version with stats tracking
auto.c - non interactive automatic version for checking with multiple runs
explanation.c - interactive explanation of the problem
